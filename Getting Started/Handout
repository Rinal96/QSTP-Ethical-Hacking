Week 1 (17th May 2016 - 22nd May 2016)

	->Need for cyber security
		You will find ample content online.

	->Disclaimer
		If you get caught doing something that you are not supposed to do, then we don't know you :P

	->Cyber Security laws in the Indian Constitution
		Indian IT ACT 2000
			https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology_Act,_2000
			http://www.dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/itbill2000_0.pdf
		IT Amendment Bill 2008
			http://www.tifrh.res.in/tcis/events/facilities/IT_act_2008.pdf
		
		You can read the entire Act if you wish to. But atleast go over the wiki page so that you have a decent idea of the laws that you are not supposed to break.

	->Cyber security laws in the BITS constitution
		https://swd.bits-goa.ac.in/Notices/Indiscipline_cases%20guidelines.pdf
		Please refrain from messing around with the Bits network. It can put you into serious trouble.

	->OWASP top 10
		If you intend to make a career in this field, then cram this piece of crap, even if you don't understand it. It is a standard interview question. You should have a decent idea of all the vulnerabilities listed in OWASP top 10.

	->History/ Popular Hacks
